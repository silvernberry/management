# Employee Resources Policy

**Usage of Personal Resources:**

- Employees utilizing their personal resources for the objectives of the foundation must adhere to the following procedures.

**Treasury Proposal Submission:**

- In case of any expenditure related to personal resources, employees are required to submit a [treasury proposal](#treasury-proposal).
- The treasury proposal should include details of the expenditure, the purpose, and the expected benefits to the foundation.

**Documentation Requirement:**

- Proper documentation such as receipts, bills, invoices, etc., must accompany the treasury proposal to validate the expenditure. Private bills can be sent to email addresses of governing body private groups, thereby, mentioning the date and time of emails/messages in the proposal to scrutinize efficiently.

**Approval Process:**

- The treasury proposal will be subjected to approval by the allocated reviewers. The reviewers will assess the relevance, necessity, and alignment with the foundation's objectives before granting approval.

**Pre-Proposal Resource Usage:**

- Any resources used before the submission and approval of the treasury proposal shall be deemed invalid.
- A proposal notification must precede the utilization of personal resources for the objectives of the foundation.

**Compliance and Accountability:**

- Employees are expected to comply with the established procedures to ensure transparency and accountability in resource usage.
- Failure to adhere to the policy may result in non-reimbursement of expenditures incurred using personal resources.


# Grievance Procedures

**Grievance Submission:**

- In the event of any concerns or grievances, employees are required to formally communicate their grievances via written email to the concerned team head.
- The written email should include a clear and detailed description of the grievance, the parties involved, and any relevant supporting documentation.

**Responsibility of Team Head:**

- Upon receipt of a grievance, the team head is responsible for acknowledging the receipt of the complaint within a reasonable timeframe.
- The team head will initiate an internal investigation to understand the nature of the grievance and gather relevant information.

**Communication and Resolution:**

- Regular updates will be provided to the employee throughout the investigation process.
- The team head will work towards resolving the grievance in a fair and timely manner.
- If the resolution involves actions or changes that affect multiple team, collaboration with other relevant team heads may be necessary.

**Escalation Procedure:**

- If the employee is dissatisfied with the resolution provided by the team head, they may escalate the grievance to the next level of management.
- The escalation should follow a hierarchical order, moving from the immediate supervisor to higher levels of management as necessary.

**Confidentiality:**

- All information related to the grievance will be treated with the utmost confidentiality to protect the privacy and well-being of the individuals involved.

**Record Keeping:**

- A record of the grievance, investigation, and resolution details will be maintained for future reference and audit purposes.

**Feedback Mechanism:**

- Following the resolution of the grievance, feedback will be sought from the employee to assess the effectiveness of the resolution process and identify areas for improvement.

# Dispute Resolution

**Mediation:**

- In cases where a dispute arises and cannot be resolved through the grievance procedures, mediation may be employed as an alternative dispute resolution method.
- An impartial third party, such as a mediator, may be engaged to facilitate communication and assist in reaching a mutually agreeable resolution.

**Arbitration:**

- If mediation proves unsuccessful, arbitration may be considered. This involves the appointment of an impartial arbitrator to make a final and binding decision on the matter.

**Legal Action:**

- In extreme cases where internal mechanisms are exhausted, legal action may be pursued. However, it is encouraged to explore alternative dispute resolution methods before resorting to legal proceedings.

**Conclusion:**

- The grievance procedures and dispute resolution mechanisms are designed to ensure a fair and transparent process for addressing employee concerns. Open communication, confidentiality, and a commitment to resolution are the key principles guiding these processes.
